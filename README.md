# Quizzler

A new Flutter project demonstrating the use of lists and the OOP concepts in dart.

## Getting Started

This app is a small quiz app with around 15 questions.
It keeps track of the correct answers and displays your score at the end.
You need to get more than half correct to pass. XD.
Questions have to be added manually, an efficient method for that has not yet been implemented.
